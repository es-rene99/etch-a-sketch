# TOP Etch a Sketch

## Cool things I learned

- I tried using canvas but apparently it requires different js methods [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp]
- There's a lot of discussion for the best way to remove multiple children of an HTML but the best way appears to be setting the node.innerHTML to empty based on Gabriel McAdams and npjohns answer. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3955229/remove-all-child-elements-of-a-dom-node-in-javascript]
- Although the site is responsive on mobile, I'm still pending to make it work on mobile, as the controls for activating with swipes are different on mobile, [need to check on HammerJS later](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15084675/how-to-implement-swipe-gestures-for-mobile-devices) as with Jquery mobile I was unable to implement.
