## Cool things I learned

- I tried using canvas but apparently it requires different js methods [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp]
- There's a lot of discussion for the best way to remove multiple children of an HTML but the best way appears to be setting the node.innerHTML to empty based on Gabriel McAdams and npjohns answer. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3955229/remove-all-child-elements-of-a-dom-node-in-javascript]
